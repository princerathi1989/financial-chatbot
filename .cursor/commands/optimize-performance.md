# Optimize System Performance

Optimize the multi-agent chatbot system for better performance and efficiency.

## Areas to Optimize
- Vector store query performance
- Document processing speed
- Memory usage optimization
- API response times
- Concurrent request handling

## Performance Metrics
- Response time per agent
- Memory consumption
- CPU usage during processing
- Vector store query latency
- Document ingestion throughput

## Optimization Strategies
1. Implement caching for frequent queries
2. Optimize chunk sizes and overlap
3. Use async processing where possible
4. Implement connection pooling
5. Add request rate limiting
6. Optimize vector store indexing
7. Implement lazy loading for large documents

## Monitoring
- Set up performance monitoring
- Track key metrics over time
- Identify bottlenecks
- Monitor resource usage
